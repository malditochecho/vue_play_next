CHATGPT prompt:

i need to make an app to create the definitive ranking of my favorite movies of all times. this are the requirements:

- there cannot be two movies with the same score
- i will assign a rounded score from 1 to 10
- when a movie is added the app will give me comparisons of the new movie with all the movies with the same score, and i will choose my favorite between those two. the system will use a weight system based on logic that will give a decimal score over the original score to avoid repeated scores

how can i design this app?

---

let say i have 4 movies but i prefer each one of them over the other in a circular way. for example the preference is like this:

A > B
B > D
D > C
C > A

how can i create a rank? is there a way to define a score based on comparisons?

In your scenario, you have a circular preference, which makes it challenging to assign a traditional numerical score to each movie. However, you can still create a ranking based on pairwise comparisons using a method such as the Elo rating system or the Bradley-Terry model.

Elo Rating System:
The Elo rating system is commonly used in competitive environments such as chess to rank players based on their performance in pairwise competitions. Each movie would start with an initial Elo rating, and after each comparison, the ratings would be adjusted based on the outcome.
Bradley-Terry Model:
The Bradley-Terry model is a statistical method used to rank items based on pairwise comparisons. In your case, you would compare each pair of movies and use the outcomes to estimate the relative strengths of the movies.
Here's how you could apply these methods to your scenario:

Assign Initial Ratings:
Start by assigning each movie an initial rating. You could start with equal ratings for simplicity.
Pairwise Comparisons:
Perform pairwise comparisons between movies based on your preferences. For each comparison, update the ratings of the movies involved using the Elo rating system or the Bradley-Terry model.
Ranking:
Once you have performed enough pairwise comparisons, you can rank the movies based on their ratings. Movies with higher ratings are considered to be ranked higher in the list.
Iterative Process:
You may need to iterate through multiple rounds of pairwise comparisons to converge to a stable ranking. As you perform more comparisons, the rankings become more accurate.
By using methods like the Elo rating system or the Bradley-Terry model, you can create a ranking that reflects your preferences even in cases where there is a circular preference among the movies. These methods allow you to derive meaningful rankings from pairwise comparisons without the need for assigning traditional numerical scores.
